# Master Implementation Checklist — Quality Autopilot Ecosystem

> **Living Document.** This checklist tracks progress across all phases of the Quality Autopilot build. It follows the **"slow and sturdy"** gated philosophy defined in [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md).
>
> **Rules:**
> 1. Treat each phase as a **Gate**. Do not check off a task unless the Definition of Done (DoD) is fully met.
> 2. Do not begin the next phase until the current phase's Gate is cleared.
> 3. Update this file as the solution grows, evolves, or progresses.
> 4. Use `[ ]` for pending, `[/]` for in-progress, and `[x]` for completed.
