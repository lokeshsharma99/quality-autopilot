# Quality Autopilot

**Agentic Compiler for the Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC).**

Quality Autopilot treats AI as a Senior SDET that reasons through requirements, writes Playwright automation, and self-heals broken tests.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) (running)
- Ollama Cloud API key (or configure your own OpenAI-compatible endpoint)

### Setup

```bash
# 1. Copy environment file and configure your API keys
cp example.env .env
# Edit .env and set at minimum:
#   - OLLAMA_API_KEY=your_api_key
#   - OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://host.docker.internal:11434 (or your Ollama Cloud endpoint)
#   - OLLAMA_MODEL=gpt-oss:120b-cloud (or your preferred model)

# 2. Start all services (includes qap-db, qap-api, qap-ui)
docker compose up -d --build

# 3. Verify the API is healthy
curl http://localhost:8000/health
# Expected response: {"status":"ok","instantiated_at":"..."}
```

## Advanced Features

### Memory and Session Management

All agents are configured with:
- **update_memory_on_run=True**: Automatically updates user memories on each run
- **enable_session_summaries=True**: Generates session summaries for better context
- **learning=True**: Enables learned knowledge storage and retrieval
- **add_learnings_to_context=True**: Adds learnings to agent context

These features enable agents to learn from interactions and maintain context across sessions.

### Metrics and Monitoring

AgentOS provides built-in metrics at `/metrics` endpoint:
- Token usage metrics (input, output, total, cached, reasoning)
- Agent/team/workflow run counts
- User counts and model metrics
- Daily aggregated analytics

Query metrics:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/metrics
```

### Session Management API

Quality Autopilot exposes session management endpoints:
- `GET /sessions?user_id={user_id}` - List sessions for a user
- `GET /sessions/{session_id}` - Get session details
- `GET /sessions/{session_id}/runs` - Get session runs history

For full session management capabilities, use the AgentOSClient:
```python
from agno.client import AgentOSClient

client = AgentOSClient(base_url="http://localhost:8000")
sessions = await client.get_sessions(user_id="user123")
```

### Event Streaming

AgentOS supports real-time event streaming for monitoring agent/team/workflow runs:

**Event Types:**
- `RunStarted`: Triggered when a run starts
- `RunCompleted`: Triggered when a run completes
- `ToolCallStarted`: Triggered when a tool call begins
- `ToolCallCompleted`: Triggered when a tool call completes
- `ToolCallError`: Triggered when a tool call fails
- `MemoryUpdateStarted`: Triggered when memory update begins
- `MemoryUpdateCompleted`: Triggered when memory update completes

**Enable Event Streaming:**
```python
result = await agent.arun(
    "Analyze this requirement",
    stream_events=True
)
```

**Team Event Streaming:**
```python
async for event in team.arun(
    prompt,
    stream=True,
    stream_events=True
):
    print(f"Event: {event.event}")
```

### AgentOSClient Integration

For remote execution and session management, use the AgentOSClient:

```python
import asyncio
from agno.client import AgentOSClient

async def main():
    client = AgentOSClient(base_url="http://localhost:8000")

    # Get configuration
    config = await client.aget_config()

    # Run an agent
    result = await client.run_agent(
        agent_id="architect",
        message="Analyze this requirement"
    )

    # Manage sessions
    session = await client.create_session(
        agent_id="architect",
        user_id="user123",
        session_name="My Session"
    )

asyncio.run(main())
```

See `examples/agentos_client_example.py` for a complete example.

## AUT (Application Under Test)

Default target: [nopCommerce Demo](https://demo.nopcommerce.com/)

Configure in `.env`:
```bash
AUT_BASE_URL=https://demo.nopcommerce.com/
AUT_AUTH_USER=your_username
AUT_AUTH_PASS=your_password
```

## Security

Quality Autopilot implements multiple layers of security through Agno guardrails to protect against common threats:

### Guardrails

**PII Detection Guardrail**
- Applied to: Architect, Scribe
- Purpose: Prevents personally identifiable information from entering the system
- Detects: Email addresses, phone numbers, SSNs, credit card numbers, addresses
- Action: Blocks input containing PII and requests sanitized input

**Prompt Injection Guardrail**
- Applied to: Architect, Scribe, Engineer
- Purpose: Prevents malicious prompt injection attacks
- Detects: Attempts to bypass agent instructions, jailbreak attempts, system prompt overrides
- Action: Blocks suspicious input and maintains agent instruction integrity

**OpenAI Moderation Guardrail**
- Applied to: Scribe, Engineer
- Purpose: Ensures generated content complies with OpenAI content policies
- Detects: NSFW content, hate speech, violence, self-harm, sexual content
- Action: Blocks policy-violating content generation

### Quality Gate Pause Mechanism

Critical quality gates use `OnError.pause` for human-in-the-loop intervention:
- Quality Gate - Spec (Judge)
- Code Quality Gate (Judge)
- Healing Patch Validation (Healing Judge)
- Final Quality Gate (Judge)

When a quality gate fails (confidence < 90%):
- Workflow pauses at the quality gate step
- User can choose to retry (send back for rework) or skip (escalate to human)
- Retry count is tracked to prevent infinite loops
- Enables flexible intervention without forcing automatic rework

## Development

```bash
# View service logs
docker compose logs -f qap-api
docker compose logs -f qap-ui

# Stop all services
docker compose down

# Restart a specific service
docker compose restart qap-api

# Format & validate code
./scripts/format.sh
./scripts/validate.sh
```

## Testing the Discovery Agent

1. Open Agent UI at http://localhost:3000
2. Select the **Discovery** agent
3. Enter prompt: "Crawl https://demo.nopcommerce.com/ and generate a Site Manifesto"
4. The agent will use curl_cffi to bypass Cloudflare and extract the site structure
5. Review the generated SiteManifesto JSON output

## Troubleshooting

**Services not starting?**
```bash
# Check Docker is running
docker ps

# View logs for errors
docker compose logs
```

**Agent UI not connecting?**
- Ensure qap-api is running: `docker compose ps qap-api`
- Check API health: `curl http://localhost:8000/health`
- Verify NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL in compose.yaml points to qap-api
